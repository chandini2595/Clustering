# Image Clustering

**Overview**

This project demonstrates the use of image clustering techniques to group similar images into clusters based on their features. The notebook implements key steps for loading, processing, and clustering images, showcasing how unsupervised learning can be applied to image datasets.

**Features**

1. Image Preprocessing: Loading images, resizing, normalization, and feature extraction.
2. Feature Extraction: Utilizes techniques such as SIFT, HOG, or CNN-based embeddings to extract relevant image features.
3. Clustering Algorithms: Implements clustering methods like K-Means, DBSCAN, or hierarchical clustering to group images.
4. Visualization: Includes visual representations of clusters for interpretability.
5. Performance Analysis: Evaluates the clustering results using metrics such as Silhouette Score or Davies-Bouldin Index.
