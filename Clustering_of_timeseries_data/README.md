# Time Series Clustering Analysis

This project demonstrates different approaches to clustering time series data, including traditional statistical features and specialized time series clustering methods. The implementation showcases how to identify patterns and group similar time series together.

**Overview**

Time series clustering is the process of grouping similar time series data points together. This implementation includes:

1. Basic statistical feature-based clustering
2. Specialized time series clustering using tslearn
3. Visualization of clustering results
4. Performance evaluation using silhouette score
