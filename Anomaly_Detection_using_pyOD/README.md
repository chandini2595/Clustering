# Anomaly Detection using PyOD

This project implements both univariate and multivariate anomaly detection using the Python Outlier Detection (PyOD) library. It provides functionality for detecting anomalies in time series data and multivariate datasets using different algorithms like Isolation Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors.
Features

**Univariate Anomaly Detection**

1. Time series analysis using Isolation Forest
2. Automatic anomaly detection with configurable contamination factor
3. Visualization of time series with highlighted anomalies


**Multivariate Anomaly Detection**

1. Multi-dimensional data analysis using KNN
2. Feature standardization
3. Visualization of detected anomalies in 2D space
4. Configurable number of features and samples
