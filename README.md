# K-Means Clustering

K-Means is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for clustering data into distinct groups based on similarities. It is often employed when the data lacks labels or specific categories. 

1. Initialization: Specify the number of clusters (k) you want the algorithm to find.

2. Centroid Assignment: Randomly select k initial cluster centroids.

3. Iteration: Each data point is assigned to the nearest centroid, and the centroids are recalculated based on the mean of points in each cluster. These steps are repeated until centroids stabilize or reach a maximum number of iterations.

4. Convergence: The algorithm converges when the centroids no longer change significantly, or the points are optimally assigned to clusters.
