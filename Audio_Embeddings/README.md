# Audio Analysis and Clustering Project

This project demonstrates audio signal processing and machine learning techniques to generate, analyze, and cluster synthetic audio signals. It creates sine waves at different musical frequencies, extracts their features, and uses K-means clustering to group similar audio segments.

**Overview:**

The project performs the following main tasks:

1. Generates synthetic audio files at specific musical frequencies
2. Extracts RMS (Root Mean Square) energy features from the audio
3. Applies K-means clustering to group similar audio segments
4. Visualizes the results using matplotlib
